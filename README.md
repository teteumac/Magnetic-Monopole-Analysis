# Generation and Simulation

## Instructions for Generating Events with MadGraph

First, you must configure the environment. Inside the repository you can see the executable `environment_config_mg5.sh`.
Edit this script fallowing the steps:
* Choice the CMSSW release in the line 4 and modified the line 7 too.
* The line 33 and 36, change the path to you path until `$YOUPATH/src/MG5_aMC_v2_9_16/HEPTools/lhapdf6_py3/share/LHAPDF`
* Run this code with `./environment_config_mg5.sh`
* Open the new terminal
* Enter inside the CMSSW release that you create, for exemple `cd CMSSW_10_6_22/src/MG5_aMC_v2_9_16`
* Run this command to have acess the python 3.8 `source /afs/cern.ch/user/m/matheus/public/hepenv_setup.sh`
   
Now you may be able to run the code for generating the events.
The `Generation_Monopolo_MG5.py` file is responsible for the entire generation process. On lines 39 and 40 you should change the paths to the absolute path of the madgraph(`MADGRAPH_PATH_RUN`) and the output in your `eos` where the generation will be saved (`OUTPUT_DIR`).

    
     MADGRAPH_PATH_RUN = '/afs/cern.ch/user/m/matheus/CMSSW_10_6_24/src/MG5_aMC_v2_9_15/bin/mg5_aMC'
     OUTPUT_DIR = '/eos/home-m/matheus/magnetic_monopole_output'

The shell code `submit_mg5_condor.sh` is the executable that will be allocated to the condor (`condor_sub_mg5.sub`)

If you want to generate local code, just run it locally using

   
    python3 Generation_Monopolo_MG5.py -mass 1000 -events 100 -itera 10 -process photon_fusion -spin half

    -mass 1000 --> Monopole mass
    -events 100 --> How many events do you want to generate
    -itera 10 --> Number of times you want to generate the same code
    -process photon_fusion --> Which process do you want to run: Drell Yan or Photon Fusion
    -spin half --> Which spin do you want: Spin 0 or Spin 1/2


*OBSERVATION:* Remember to change all code directories to yours.

For this analysis we are using recent results obtained by ATLAS on the lower limits of the monopole mass:

This table shows the first two columns with the value of the monopole's magnetic charge and the last are the HECOs particles charge.

When the condor over, you must have 2000 files. You can count how files you have with these command 
      
      find /eos/home-m/matheus/magnetic_monopole_output -maxdepth 1 -type f | wc -l
